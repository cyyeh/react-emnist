# React MobileNet

See [Project Demo Site Here](https://mobilenet-react.netlify.app/)

This project is a React App with MobileNet Prediction Using TensorFlow.js. I wrote this project in 2019, now I upgrade all package dependencies to the latest version and use React Hook instead for refactoring. This project is being deployed using Netlify.
